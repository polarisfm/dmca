To whom it may concern,

I am contacting you on behalf of the Free Software community and its members.

Fuck the M-P-double-A comin' straight out the underground<br>
A young pirate got it bad cause I'm down,<br>
Loadin' DVDs like a motherfuckin' fiend,<br>
Bring my camera to the movies and I put em on BT,<br>
Back all that stolen content up on DVD-ROMs,<br>
'Cuz my tip's been piracy since I dropped out my Mom's,<br>
And just because I share my OGGs,<br>
They got the government comin' after me,<br>
Instead of suin' kids why don't you step on up,<br>
And release a couple albums that don't completely suck,<br>
Stop puttin DRM onto audio CDs,<br>
That don't make it any harder to steal your OGGs,<br>
If I want your shit for free, I ain't gonna have to pay,<br>
And all your bullshit is why the fuck I say,<br>
Hack the Gibson, hack the Gibson,<br>
I'm seedin' BitTorrents like a digital pimp, son.

Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA<br>
Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA

Robot pirates, we get our shit for free,<br>
Parental Advisory you'll never fuckin' see,<br>
Been a couple years since I seen an FBI warning,<br>
Cut it out cause that shit's mad boring,<br>
Ya'll fuckin dumber than that bitch from bad boys,<br>
Step to the Bin and it's grandma's sex toys,<br>
I'ma just keep fillin' up muh drives,<br>
The ones that disapear when the lawsuit arrives,<br>
All you fuckin suits can suck my balls,<br>
When you get done you gonna make some calls,<br>
I better see some changes or it's time to fight,<br>
You ain't gonna manage my digital rights.

Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA<br>
Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA

Remember when anti-trust was the thing,<br>
Now you're set up for downloadin' Sting,<br>
Treatin' payin' customers like criminals,<br>
Pens filled up with music nerd animals,<br>
Buyin' off senators left and right,<br>
My vote doesnt count in this fuckin' fight,<br>
On the 56k had hundreds of songs,<br>
Drives partitioned like asses in thongs,
Now its gigs of illegal content,<br>
If I get caught I'm joinin' a convent,<br>
Fuck what you heard, it's all a scam,<br>
If they at your door burn 'em in a van.

Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA<br>
Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA

They got dollar signs in their fuckin' eyes,<br>
With heads in-between politicians' thighs,<br>
Fat checks endorsed by senators that lie,<br>
Pullin' fake dollar losses straight outta the sky,<br>
And I don't trust trusted computing,<br>
They don't want it around to stop looting,<br>
The internet is the only place you're still free,<br>
If you disagree, just you wait and see,<br>
You wanna lock down the web and throw away the key?<br>
Well, you better not touch my fuckin' technology,<br>
So back the fuck off or you're fuckin' dead,<br>
Yellin' 1337 on a motherfuckin' fed.

Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA<br>
Fuck the M-P-double-A<br>
Fuck the R-I-double-A<br>
Fuck the suits behind the BSA<br>
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA

Sincerely,<br>
