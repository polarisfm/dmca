Dear Sir or Madam:

I am contacting you on behalf of the Free Software community and its members.

Fuck the M-P-double-A comin' straight out the underground
A young pirate got it bad cause I'm down,
Loadin' DVDs like a motherfuckin' fiend,
Bring my camera to the movies and I put em on BT,
Back all that stolen content up on DVD-ROMs,
'Cuz my tip's been piracy since I dropped out my Mom's,
And just because I share my MP3s,
They got the government comin' after me,
Instead of suin' kids why don't you step on up,
And release a couple albums that don't completely suck,
Stop puttin DRM onto audio CDs,
That don't make it any harder to steal your MP3s,
If I want your shit for free, I ain't gonna have to pay,
And all your bullshit is why the fuck I say,
Hack the Gibson, hack the Gibson,
I'm seedin' BitTorrents like a digital pimp, son.

Fuck the M-P-double-A
Fuck the R-I-double-A
Fuck the suits behind the BSA
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA

Robot pirates, we get our shit for free,
Parental Advisory you'll never fuckin' see,
Been a couple years since I seen an FBI warning,
Cut it out cause that shit's mad boring,
Ya'll fuckin dumber than that bitch from bad boys,
Step to the Bin and it's grandma's sex toys,
I'ma just keep fillin' up muh drives,
The ones that disapear when the lawsuit arrives,
All you fuckin suits can suck my balls,
When you get done you gonna make some calls,
I better see some changes or it's time to fight,
You ain't gonna manage my digital rights.

Remember when anti-trust was the thing,
Now you're set up for downloadin' Sting,
Treatin' payin' customers like criminals,
Pens filled up with music nerd animals,
Buyin' off senators left and right,
My vote doesnt count in this fuckin' fight,
On the 56k had hundreds of songs,
Drives partitioned like asses in thongs,
Now its gigs of illegal content,
If I get caught I'm joinin' a convent,
Fuck what you heard, it's all a scam,
If they at your door burn 'em in a van.

They got dollar signs in their fuckin' eyes,
With heads in-between politicians' thighs,
Fat checks endorsed by senators that lie,
Pullin' fake dollar losses straight outta the sky,
And I don't trust trusted computing,
They don't want it around to stop looting,
The internet is the only place you're still free,
If you disagree, just you wait and see,
You wanna lock down the web and throw away the key?
Well, you better not touch my fuckin' technology,
So back the fuck off or you're fuckin' dead,
Yellin' 1337 on a motherfuckin' fed.

Fuck the M-P-double-A
Fuck the R-I-double-A
Fuck the suits behind the BSA
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA
Fuck the M-P-double-A
Fuck the R-I-double-A
Fuck the suits behind the BSA
And fuck 'em all for the DMCA

Sincerely,
